| 1-2 | Shallow Water Gravity Waves | _Elementary but brief descriptions of water waves (not confined to those on shallow water) can be found in:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Open University Course Team. Chap. 1 in _Waves, Tides and Shallow-Water Processes._ The Open University: Pergamon Press, 1989. ISBN: 0080363717.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Acheson, D. J. _Elementary Fluid Dynamics_. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1990. ISBN: 9780198596790.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Other treatments can be found in many fluid dynamics texts, but are usually much more advanced and more mathematical than these two. One particularly thorough treatment is in:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Lighthill, James. Chap. 3 in _Waves in Fluids_. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2001.  ISBN: 9780521010450. |
| 3-4 | Deep Water Gravity Waves | Same as for sessions 1-2 |
| 5-6 | Internal Gravity Waves | _Internal gravity waves are covered to some extent in many texts of geophysical fluid dynamics. A detailed but thorough treatment is given in:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Gill, A. E. Chap. 6 in _Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics_. San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 1982. ISBN: 9780122835223. |

| 8-9 | Tides | _An elementary discussion of ocean tides is given in:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Open University Course Team. Chap. 1 in _Waves, Tides and Shallow-Water Processes._ The Open University: Pergamon Press, 1989. ISBN: 0080363717.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_A comprehensive discussion of the mathematical theory of tides on a global ocean is given in the classical text:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Lamb, H. _Hydrodynamics_. Cambridge University Press, 1916.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_For a discussion of atmospheric tides (including an historical account of the resonance theory) see:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Lindzen, R. S.

| 17-18 | The Equatorial Atmosphere and Ocean | &nbsp; |
| 19-20 | El Niño and the Southern Oscillation | _A good, basic discussion of all the issues presented here (and several of the figures), as well as discussion of the impact of El_ _Nino, can be found in:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Philander, S. G. _El Nino, La Nina and the Southern Oscillation_. San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 1989. ISBN: 9780125532358. (The later chapters are at an advanced level.)  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_An interesting series of articles on the large 1982-83 El Nino was published in Science on 16 Dec 1983.
